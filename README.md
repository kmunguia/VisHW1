# VisHW1

## Design Process:
A discussion of design decisions and changes you made to your design along the way. Were you able to include everything that you had thought of in your paper prototype? 
 
At first we decided we were going to do a visualization like the one linked in [nutrients](http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/raw/3150059/). We thought that the way the authors designed their visualization to be able to interact with the data was the most efficient way to portray data.They used line marks and color hue to show variables and distinguish between them. We thought using different color lines would be a good way to distinguish items within data; however, we decided not to lable our axis with different increments like the authors did here. We have added the max of each axis at the top so that the reader can see the difference in height for each variable that an axis represents. 

We knew the requirements were that we had to make the axis move and be able to filter. We were also under impression that we were creating a visulization for a specific data set (in this case nutrients) and so once we realized that our visualization had to work for multiple vis like cars and nutrients we had to redesign our code structure. It did not affect our actual design because we thought the the different colored lines and the interactivity would work for any data that was processed through our visualization system. 

### Interactivity

A description of how your interactivity works (a userâ€™s manual), and a justification of your design decisions using concepts we have covered in the class. Does your design work? What could be improved, given more time, and how? Did you come up with any interactivity mechanisms to support tasks other than those described above?

So our interactivity that we implemented was making of rectangles on the screen and being able to move the axis. We were not able to have both of them work at the same time but were
